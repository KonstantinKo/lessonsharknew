			<div class="right_text">Who are your Teachers?</div>
			<div class="inner_text">Our Teachers are skilled educators in your community. Only Teachers who have a completed profile and an approved background check are allowed to appear in our search results. Our Teacher Profiles will help you get to know each teacher's personality and teaching style so you can make the right choice for you or your family.</div>

			<div class="right_text">What does "Approved Background" mean?</div>
			<div class="inner_text">"Approved Background" is displayed on every Teacher Profile because to complete their profile, Teachers must pass our Background Check. In order for a Teacher to pass, we must be able to verify their social security number, find no criminal, federal, or mis-demeanor convictions, and the Teacher must not appear on the National Sex Offender registry. The Teacher's address history from the past 7 years is also used to search for criminal records. Non-criminal traffic violations are not part of our review process.</div>

			<div class="right_text">What does "Verified Degree" mean?</div>
			<div class="inner_text">An instructor profile that displays, "LessonShark Verified Degree" indicates that the Instructor has run a degree verification with our Partner, The National Student Clearinghouse. The NSC is a non-profit organization that exists to independently verify that a person has in fact earned their college degree. We added this feature to LessonShark because being sure about your instructor's qualifications is paramount to making the right choice for your lessons.</div>

			<div class="right_text">What is the difference between LessonShark and a Traditional Lessons Agency?</div>
			<div class="inner_text">Before LessonShark, Students had to choose which Company they would take lessons with. With LessonShark, Students choose which Teacher they will take lessons with.
	<br><br>
			LessonShark offers Students and Teachers all of the tools they will need to have a pleasant lessons experience, while still allowing Teachers to be independent and Students to choose freely. Traditional Lessons Agencies act as a middle-man that stands between the Student and Teacher, controlling everything from lesson price to cancellation policies, as well as keeping up to 35% of the Student's tuition payments. With LessonShark, 85% - 95% of the Student's tuition dollars go directly to the Instructor.
